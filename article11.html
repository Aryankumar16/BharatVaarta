            Battle of Plassey : A turning point in the Indian History
        </h1>
    </div>
    <p>This was a turning point in Indian history. It was June 23, 1757, when the British East India Company had defeated the Nawab of Bengal, Siraj-ud-Daulah. This defeat led to British colonial rule in India.</p>
<h2>The rise of the East India Company</h2>
<p>The British East India Company, initially a trading house, started to build its political and military strength in India. The company had consolidated a firm hold on Bengal, which was a prosperous province, as the mid-18th century progressed. Rising tensions between the company and the Nawab of Bengal were caused by disputes over trade and taxation issues.</p>

<h2>Battle of Plassey</h2>
<p>Even though Plassey was quite an unimportant battle with far bigger and more significant fallouts, the British victory did depend on the disparity of manpower: Robert Clive versus the Nawab. At any rate, strategy rather than manpower proved Clive to be the wittiest man in any way related to the cause because his opponent's leading Nawab commander, Mir Jafar, happened to betray him.</p>

<p>Mir Jafar, who wished to become the Nawab, betrayed the Nawab with the British. The Nawab's army was left to be ill-equipped and de-moralized. The day of the battle the troops of Mir Jafar remained inactive that helped the British to defeat the forces of Nawab.</p>

<h2>Conclusion of Plassey</h2>
<p>Victory at Plassey marked the first turning point in Indian history. After victory at Plassey, the British East India Company extended its dominion over other parts of India. The company ruled India for nearly two hundred years and determined the country's political, economic, and social life.</p>

<p>The Battle of Plassey was the foundation of British colonial power in India. This marks the commencement of a very dark period of exploitation and suppression but marked the beginning of certain periods of cultural exchange and modernization. The British introduced various administrative systems, new legal codes, and new schools and institutions. They exploited Indian resources and people mercilessly.</p>

<p>The legacy of the Battle of Plassey is still a debatable matter. While it opened a dark chapter in Indian history, it paved the way to Indian nationalism and finally led toward India's independence struggle.</p>
