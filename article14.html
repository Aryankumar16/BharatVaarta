    <div class="header"><h1>The Sikh Empire under Maharaja Ranjit Singh</h1></div>
    <p>Sikh Empire has been one of the brilliant times in the timeline of India, and political stability, economic prosperity, and cultural renaissance, while entering Punjab regions which formed a power state.</p>

<p>A visionary ruler, Ranjit Singh merged all the different Sikh misls and finally brought out a strong centralized administration. He recruited a formidable army of Sikhs, Hindus, and Muslims and armed it with modern weapons. It was a well-trained and disciplined army that would safeguard the empire and scare off foreign invasions.</p>

<p>Under Ranjit Singh, the economy of the Punjab flourished significantly. He promoted trade and commerce, and his government upheld law and order in that region, making it an economically prosperous center of action. The treasury of the empire was filled and infrastructures were improved.</p>

<p>Military and economic achievements aside, Ranjit Singh was a patron of arts and culture. He rebuilt the holiest shrine of the Sikhs, the Harmandir Sahib, along with other religious sites. It facilitated religious harmony and tolerance, and the Sikh Empire became a melting pot of cultures, where people of various faiths could coexist peacefully under the rule of Ranjit Singh.</p>

<p>However, decline started after the death of Ranjit Singh in 1839. Weak and ineffective successors, along with internal conflicts and external pressures, further weakened the empire. British East India Company, capitalizing on the opportunity, finally annexed Punjab through the two Anglo-Sikh wars. Â  </p>

<p>Although the Sikh Empire was only for a short time, the effects were long-lasting.</p>

<p>It demonstrated a strong, secular, and prosperous India. The power of the empire in warfare, administrative efficiency, and cultural tolerance are a hallmark that inspires admiration and respect.</p>
