        <h1>The Jallianwala Bagh Massacre and it's impact on Indian Independence</h1>
    </div>
    <p>The Jallianwala Bagh massacre, a horrific event that took place on April 13, 1919, was a defining moment in India's struggle for independence. This tragic incident, which occurred in Amritsar, Punjab, forever etched itself into the nation's collective memory.   
    </p>
<p>On that fateful day, a large crowd of unarmed Indians, including women and children, had gathered at Jallianwala Bagh to protest against the oppressive Rowlatt Act.</p>

<p> The Act, passed by the British government, gave authorities the power to detain individuals without trial. As the peaceful gathering progressed, British troops, led by Brigadier General Reginald Dyer, blocked all exits to the Bagh and opened fire on the defenseless crowd. The indiscriminate firing continued for several minutes, resulting in a horrific massacre.   </p>

<p>The exact number of casualties remains disputed, but estimates range from hundreds to over a thousand. The massacre had a profound impact on the Indian people, igniting a wave of anger and resentment against British rule. It shattered the illusion of British justice and exposed the brutality of colonial power.  </p> 

<p>The Jallianwala Bagh massacre marked a turning point in the Indian independence movement. It galvanized the nation and strengthened the resolve of Indian leaders like Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi, who had previouseaceful protest, was deeply affected by the tragedy. He launched the Non-Cooperation Movement in 1920, a mass civil disobedience campaign that aimed to force the British to grant India independence. </p>  

<p>The massacre also had a significant impact on the global perception of British rule in India. It sparked international condemnation and exposed the oppressive nature of colonial power. The incident further fueled the growing nationalist sentiment in India and brought the country closer to achieving its goal of self-governance.</p>   

<p>The Jallianwala Bagh massacre remains a poignant reminder of the sacrifices made by countless Indians in the struggle for freedom. It serves as a powerful symbol of the human cost of oppression and the enduring spirit of the Indian people. </p>
